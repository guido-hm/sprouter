# sprouter
**Keep track of your homegrown broccoli, kale, alfalfa, or any other type of sprouts you can imagine!**

--------
This was my very first attempt at creating a python program with a GUI, just months after I began to program. I got the idea to make this after my family decided
to start growing brocolli sprouts in jars, various batches at a time. This program allows the user to enter the details of each batch (jar) and keep track of it to remember when to water the jar, when to expose it to sunlight, and when to harvest. It also keeps track of costs associated with the batch.

I plan on revisiting this project soon, with a much greater understanding of Object-Oriented Programming, to improve the code
